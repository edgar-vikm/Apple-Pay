### Should we trust in Apple Pay to keep us safe?

Apple pay mitigates the risk by using payment token technology to protect consumer credit cards from fraud. A significant strength is the convenience of apple pay but also how secure it is. However, most of their weaknesses aren't related to technical performance. Instead, it mostly revolves around public perception of information being unsecure in "the cloud" or merchants simply not wanting to adopt apple pay.
